There were 4 friends at the park Tommy, Bobby, Danny and Sammy. They had a bucket of 4 apples
to share with each other. Since there are 4 apples in the bucket each friend got one apple. 
When they began to split the apples our friend Jonny came to the park. He also wanted to eat
an apple but there was not enough for all to get one each. So they had to split the apples into
20 slices so they can split them evenly with all 5 friends. In the end Tommy, Bobby, Danny, Sammy
and Jonny were all happy with 4 slices of apple each.
